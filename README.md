# To Do App
## Description
_Duration:_ Weekend project
This is a basic to do list, where a user can make a checklist of things to do and mark them off as them complete them.

In building this app, I practiced skills for full stack integration, connecting a jquery-powered front end through a node server to a SQL database.
